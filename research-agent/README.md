# Research Agent Notebook

This Jupyter notebook implements a **research agent** using the [`aisuite`](https://pypi.org/project/aisuite/) Python library. The agent is designed to **generate, reflect on, and revise research drafts** using large language models (LLMs) in a structured workflow.

---

## Features

The notebook provides three main methods:

### 1. `generate`

- **Purpose**: Generate an initial draft for a research topic or prompt.
- **Input**: Topic, research question, or prompt string.
- **Output**: Draft text generated by the LLM.
- **Usage Example**:

```python
draft = generate("Impact of AI on climate modeling")
```

### 2. `reflect`

- **Purpose**: Analyze and provide feedback on the generated draft.
- **Input**: Draft text + reflection notes.
- **Output**: Reflection notes, suggestions for improvement, or identification of gaps.
- **Usage Example**:

```python
reflection = reflect(draft)
```

### 3. `revise`

- **Purpose**: Revise the draft based on reflections or additional feedback.
- **Input**: Draft text..
- **Output**: Revised draft text.
- **Usage Example**:

```python
revised_draft = revise(draft, reflection)
```
